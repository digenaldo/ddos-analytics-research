# DDoS Attack Analytics Research Project

## Overview
The threat of application layer DDoS attacks is escalating, underscoring the need for effective detection methods to safeguard networked systems. With attackers constantly evolving their techniques, cybersecurity efforts are becoming more challenging. In response, leveraging advanced artificial intelligence technologies emerges as a promising avenue for bolstering defenses.

## Project Description
This project presents a detection scheme utilizing machine learning and assesses its performance using big data analytics. Four classification algorithms are evaluated for their accuracy and execution time in detecting DDoS attacks:

- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

Preliminary findings suggest the system's efficacy, showcasing high accuracy levels while maintaining reasonable response times. This integrated approach, marrying sophisticated data analysis with big data capabilities, shows potential in fortifying defenses against cyber threats within an increasingly intricate and dynamic landscape.

## Files in the Repository
- **ddos_attack_analytics_abd.py**: Contains the implementation and analysis of the detection scheme.
- **ddos_attack_analytics_apg.py**: Contains additional analytics and performance evaluation.

## Usage
To run the scripts, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts to perform the DDoS attack detection and analysis:
   ```bash
   python ddos_attack_analytics_abd.py
   python ddos_attack_analytics_apg.py
   ```

## Results
The results from the analysis include the accuracy and execution times of the four classification algorithms. The findings indicate that the integrated approach is effective in detecting DDoS attacks with high accuracy and reasonable response times.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of using machine learning and big data analytics to enhance cybersecurity defenses against application layer DDoS attacks. The promising results encourage further research and development in this domain to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.
